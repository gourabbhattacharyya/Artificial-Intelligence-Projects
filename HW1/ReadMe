In this project, your Pac-Man agent will find paths through its maze world, both to reach a particular location and
to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pac-Man scenarios.
This is a somewhat long project with several components. You are advised to start early!
The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in
order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore. You can download all the code and
supporting files (including this description) as a zip archive.
